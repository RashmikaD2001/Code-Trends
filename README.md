# 🧠 ML & AI NEXUS 2025 — Cognition Balance Equation  
### Hybrid AI Model Combining Expert Systems & Machine Learning for Heart Disease Prediction

---

## 🚀 Overview
Our solution was built for the **"Cognition Balance Equation"** challenge at **ML & AI NEXUS 2025**, which aimed to **quantify the optimal balance between emotional intuition and logical computation** in shared human–AI decision systems.  

We proposed a **hybrid AI framework** that blends:
- 🧩 **Traditional machine learning models** (logical reasoning)
- 💭 **Large Language Models (LLMs)** (intuitive, contextual understanding)

The result is an **AI cognition framework** that mirrors human-like reasoning — combining logic-driven prediction with interpretability and emotional context.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Challenge:
> Human cognition blends intuition and emotion, whereas AI employs structured logic and data-driven reasoning. Real-world problem-solving requires both modes — but how do we determine the right balance?

### Issue:
> Overreliance on logic can suppress original thinking, while pure intuition can lead to bias or errors. There is no measurement tool to balance these cognitive strengths in hybrid human–AI systems.

### Goal:
> Propose a statistical model that quantifies the optimal balance between emotional intuition and logical computation — a *“Cognition Balance Equation”* — to maximize creativity and efficiency in hybrid cognitive tasks (e.g., strategic planning, medical diagnostics, policy design).

## 💡 Our Approach: The Cognition Balance Framework

We implemented a **hybrid decision system** inspired by human cognitive balance:
| Cognitive Mode | AI Component | Description |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Logical Computation** | 🧠 Traditional ML Ensemble (Calibrated XGBoost + Random Forest) | Precise, data-driven diagnosis based on medical parameters |
| **Emotional Intuition** | 💬 LLM (Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2 model) | Generates contextual, human-like reasoning for each prediction |
| **Cognitive Fusion** | ⚖️ Weighted combination of ML output & LLM reasoning | Emulates balanced human cognition using the "Cognition Balance Equation" |
